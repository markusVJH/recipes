      "description": "Maldivian egg rolls called bikseemiyaa make a scrumptious appetizer.  This treats were a real surprise.  They are often made with tuna as well.  This version was simply a hard boiled egg with some shredded cabbage, onion, curry leaves and a hot green chili.  They are wrapped up in an egg roll wrapper and deep fried.  We devoured them and I have made them several times since.  A quick and easy appetizer that is a guaranteed winner.",
